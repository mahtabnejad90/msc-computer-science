# Software Engineering (Part One) - Week 4 - Points of Failure


## Task

1. Take a few minutes to think about real-world systems that have a single point of failure – list three of them. At least one should be a system that you use on a frequent basis. What aspect of their design gives them a single point of failure? 

2. Now think of three more systems that do not have a single point of failure – again, at least one should be a system you use frequently. How do you think their architectures are designed to cope with failures? 

## Answer


### 1.

- In-House Data centres - Companies who don’t have a back up or cloud data infrastructure and rely on an in-house server system have the potential to fail.

- Hospital Systems - Systems that are used for patient records can easily be a point of failure as there are many problems that could occur such as records being wiped, communication between data to system could fail in case of emergency requirement

- Airline traffic system could be have points of failure as 

### 2.

- Streaming service - On demand services usually have backup CDN services that can serve as a back. 

- Email services have many back up cloud servers that avoid point of failures within  their systems

- Security services - those who use security services have a couple of methods of backup to deviate from any potential threats or attacks to their systems
