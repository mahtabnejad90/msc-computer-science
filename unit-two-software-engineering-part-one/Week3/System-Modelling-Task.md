# System Modelling for the Train Ticket System

## Task

1. Review your list of requirements from last week. Feel free to edit them, or to use our requirements from the tutorial.
2. Select three system models from this week to try for yourself. (Hint: the three types of models we introduced are Context, Interaction, and Behavioural.)
3. Create three models for the TravelTime system. You can model any part of the system that you think is appropriate. For example, you could create a Context model to show the overall context of the ticketing system, then a sequence diagram to show a particular process, and finally a state diagram to show how events drive processes in the system.

*Hint: you may want to indicate which requirement(s) you are modelling.*

Proposal:

Type of Models Used:

- Block Diagram

- Use Case Diagram

- Flow Chart Diagram

The reason I chose the three above is, because they are a simple representation of the system and are readable and understandable by technical and non-technical individuals involved.

Please review the `.pdf` attachment in the Week3 directory.
