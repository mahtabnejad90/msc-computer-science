# Requirements Engineering for the Train Ticket System

## Task

Write out some preliminary requirements for the TravelTime ticketing software. You might start with 5 simple user and system requirements that you extract from the brief. (Note: you do not need to post these, this is just to guide your thinking).
Using your preliminary requirements to guide you, write out a list of functional and non-functional requirements for the TravelTime ticketing software. You should aim for at least 5 functional requirements, and 3 non-functional requirements. You should expand on these requirements down to a maximum of three levels, for example: 3.2.5.
