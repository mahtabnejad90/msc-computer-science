We’ve looked at some types of requirements so far: user requirements that describe high-level system features, and system requirements that delve down into the details of the system’s functionality. We could draw an analogy with the description of this unit. The high-level requirement of this unit is to teach the principles of software engineering. The low-level detail is that we teach software engineering by starting with the system life cycle, then requirements engineering, and so on. 
Imagine that we are a small software engineering company who has been approached by a bank with the following brief.

CashOut is a small bank operating in the UK, with offices in London, Bath and Cardiff and branches in 12 major cities. CashOut wants to hire your company to design and develop automated teller machines (ATMs) to use outside its branches. 
Customers should be able to check their balance, withdraw cash, and transfer money between their accounts. The manager of the bank is required to download a transaction history from the ATM everyday, and can approve or decline transfer requests. A bank teller can download the transaction history if the manager is away. The ATM should be reliable and secure.

Write down three simple, natural language requirements for the CashOut system.You do not need to classify these as User or System requirements yet. It is sufficient to pick out three important statements from the brief.

Proposed CashOut system requirements:

- Customers should be able to conduct banking errands.
- The bank manager & bank teller should be able to conduct daily checks on the ATMs.
- The ATMs should be secure & reliable as well as adhere to any legal or regularity aspects
