CashOut is a small bank operating in the UK, with offices in London, Bath and Cardiff and branches in 12 major cities. CashOut wants to hire your company to design and develop automated teller machines (ATMs) to use outside its branches. 
Customers should be able to check their balance, withdraw cash, and transfer money between their accounts. The manager of the bank is required to download a transaction history from the ATM everyday, and can approve or decline transfer requests. A bank teller can download the transaction history if the manager is away. The ATM should be reliable and secure. 

1. Review the three requirements you wrote last time. Let's call these your user requirements. As a reminder, user requirements are the high-level (natural language) statements describing system features. Now try creating some system requirements, using your user requirements as a guideline. Remember that system requirements are the low-level details describing functionality. If you need a reminder, you can review the page on User and System Requirements. Aim to create around three system requirements for each user requirement.
2. Post your system requirements and user requirements.
